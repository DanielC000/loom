/**
 * PL Auditor finding #8 — inject a small "Where things live" context block (the project's absolute
 * `repoPath` + `vaultPath`, PLUS the fully-resolved resume-doc path) into a MANAGER session's startup
 * prompt at spawn. A cold-boot orchestrator otherwise can't construct its resume-doc path (the daemon
 * knows the vault root, but never tells the agent) and Globs for it — a broad Glob from the user's home
 * hits the 20s ripgrep cap.
 *
 * The block is a PRE-block (context first, then the agent's own doctrine/kickoff) — mirrors how
 * `composeRunStartupPrompt` wraps a run's doctrine + input. PURE-ISH (one guarded `fs.statSync` on the
 * resolved resume-doc path — see below) + exported so the hermetic test can assert the composition.
 * MANAGERS ONLY (lowest blast radius): only `startManager` calls this, so every worker/run/plain/
 * platform/auditor spawn byte-stream is unchanged.
 *
 * The block emits the resume doc as a FULLY-RESOLVED absolute path, built SERVER-SIDE via
 * `resolveResumeDocPath` (`resume-doc-notes.ts`) from the resolved `vaultPath` PLUS the project's
 * `orchestration.resumeDocFilename` config (defaults to `"Orchestrator Log.md"` — Loom's own convention —
 * when unset, so every project that doesn't override it is byte-identical to before). `vaultPath` IS the
 * project's vault directory (e.g. `.../Obsidian Vault/Projects/Loom`) — NOT the vault root. The agent
 * Reads it verbatim with zero derivation, instead of reconstructing the path from memory and mis-spelling
 * the vault root OR assuming a filename that isn't this project's actual convention (card c1f2f095 — both
 * failure modes were observed: a hand-written prompt line AND the generic derivation formula drifted from
 * the real file when a project's resume doc used a non-default name).
 *
 * Card 809cc4b5 — a manager's resume doc grew past the harness Read cap and broke a successor's cold
 * Read. `resumeDocSizeWarning` (`resume-doc-notes.ts` — the SAME check the Platform Lead's resume doc
 * already had) is checked here too, and if the resolved doc is already oversized, its
 * `[loom:resume-doc-size]` note is prepended AHEAD of the pointer block — mirroring
 * `composePlatformLeadStartupPrompt`'s ordering, so a cold-booting successor sees "rotate this" before
 * it's told where to read it. This only covers the spawn/recycle moment; the mid-session case (a doc
 * that grows oversized while its manager stays live, never recycling) is covered separately by
 * `ResumeDocWatcher` (`orchestration/resume-doc-watcher.ts`), which resolves the SAME path via the SAME
 * `resolveResumeDocPath` — one source of truth for both call sites.
