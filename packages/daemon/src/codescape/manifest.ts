/**
 * Card 088afc94 (P4 wiring) — resolve CODESCAPE's OWN project id for a repo path by reading back the
 * plain-JSON manifest `codescape ingest` already writes, rather than reimplementing their id-generation
 * algorithm (`slugify(basename) + '-' + sha256(lowercased resolved path).slice(0,8)`, projectStore.ts
 * `projectIdFor`) here in TypeScript — CONFIRMED with the Codescape manager: never reimplement their id
 * algorithm. Reimplementing it would be a FRAGILE duplication that silently breaks the day their
 * algorithm changes, with no compile error to catch it. This is also the confirmed root cause of an
 * EARLIER abandoned HTTP-mount attempt (see pty/host.ts's `codescapeMcpServer` doc): scoping by Loom's
 * own project.id (a UUID, unrelated to codescape's path-derived id) meant the MCP mount never
 * registered — sessions 404'd silently. Reading the manifest sidesteps that class of bug entirely:
 * whatever id codescape assigned is whatever this reads back.
 *
 * PATH — CONFIRMED with Codescape, this is the part that was NOT obvious from the card alone: the
 * manifest is resolved from the SERVE PROCESS'S OWN CWD (`path.resolve(".codescape")` on their side),
 * NOT some fixed Loom-side location. Loom SUPERVISES that process and pins its launch cwd to
 * `CODESCAPE_HOME_DIR` (the CWD CONTRACT — see codescape/supervisor.ts: both `ingest` and `serve` spawn
 * from the SAME `homeDir`), which is exactly why this resolves to `<homeDir>/.codescape/projects/
 * index.json` — e.g. `<LOOM_HOME>/codescape/.codescape/projects/index.json`. This function takes
 * `homeDir` as a param rather than defaulting to `CODESCAPE_HOME_DIR` internally so it can never drift
 * from whatever cwd a given `CodescapeSupervisor` instance actually launched from (see that class's
 * `getHomeDir()` — callers should pass `codescape.getHomeDir()`, not re-derive it).
 *
 * SHAPE: `{version, projects: [{id, name, path, branch?, lastIngested, graphPath}]}`. `version` is
 * bumped on a breaking change (Codescape-confirmed) — this reads it and clean-skips + logs loudly on an
 * unexpected version rather than parsing blindly into a shape that may no longer match.
 *
 * JUNK ROWS: Codescape-confirmed — their manifest can genuinely contain a junk entry (a known arg-parse
 * bug on their side, e.g. a stray `--help` row) with a missing/malformed `path`. Every entry is
 * shape-checked before use; a junk row is skipped, never thrown on — a crash here would take out every
 * session's MCP wiring for the whole daemon, which is a wildly disproportionate blast radius for one bad
 * manifest row. See test/codescape-manifest.mjs for the junk-row coverage.
 *
 * FUTURE SWAP: Codescape is carding `GET /projects` (a live lookup) and `POST /project` (returns the id
 * directly) as conveniences, not prerequisites — this manifest-file read is what unblocks P4 today. Kept
 * as the ONE seam (`resolveCodescapeProjectId`) so swapping to a live lookup later is a one-function
 * change, not a grep-and-replace across every call site.
