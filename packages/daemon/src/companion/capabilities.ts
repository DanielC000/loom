/**
 * Companion Capability & Permission-Lever Framework — §2, the plug-in pattern (one enforcement point, not
 * one per lever). See `Projects/Loom/Design/Companion Capability & Permission-Lever Framework.md` (vault).
 *
 * A capability is enabled by the PRESENCE of a `companion_capability_grants` row (db.ts): no grant ⇒ its
 * tools are never registered on the companion's MCP surface, so it stays inert + invisible — mirroring the
 * existing `chat_reply`/`skill_*`/`memory_*`/`reminder_*` per-session companion gate
 * (`companionSessionIds.has(sessionId)` in mcp/orchestration.ts). `resolveCompanionGrant` is the ONE
 * enforcement gate every lever is read through; `registerCompanionCapabilities` is the single chokepoint
 * that iterates the registry once per `buildServer` call. Every lever's tool handler ALSO re-checks scope
 * at call time (belt-and-suspenders — mirrors why companion/factory.ts re-scopes bindings even though the
 * controller already dispatches by session id): a bug in registration-gating alone must not open the door.

 *
 * `decision_resolve` is the ACT half (card a8ddd6d2) — THE highest-risk lever in the whole catalog:
 * resolving a decision can approve owner-gated / irreversible work. It is registered ONLY when at least
 * one of this grant's projects is act-mode (`hasActGrant` below) — a read-only grant's tool surface stays
 * byte-identical to before this card. Guards, in order: (1) the question's project ∈ scope.projectIds AND
 * `mayAct` for it (belt-and-suspenders, per-project — never a collapsed scope check); (2) the question is
 * `pending` and OFFERS options (a pure-blocker ask has none — that stays human-only, free-text-note
 * answers are out of scope for this lever); (3) `chosenOption` is one of those offered options; (4) a
 * `decisionClasses` allowlist in this project's grant config — CONSERVATIVE DEFAULT (owner sign-off
 * 1039e892): an absent/empty allowlist admits NOTHING, mirroring `attention-push`'s own "absent config ⇒
 * nothing subscribed" default, so deploy/irreversible (and even `general`) decisions all require the
 * owner to explicitly opt in; (5) Primitive A — the call must be on an owner-authored turn at all
 * (`attest.getActiveTurnOwnerText` non-null); (6) a reply-to ROUTE must exist for the current turn — with
 * no route there is no verified channel back to the owner, so the propose is refused outright (CR
 * hardening — see below); (7) Primitive C — the call never resolves on its own: it PROPOSES (mints a
 * confirm token via `attest.proposeConfirmation`, remembers the validated payload in
 * `pendingDecisionResolves`) and only a LATER `decision_resolve` call, on the owner's own next turn whose
 * text contains that token (`attest.confirmPending`), actually calls `db.answerQuestion` — reusing the
 * exact write the human decision-inbox UI and `question_pull` rely on, never a reimplementation. A
 * free-text `note` is only checked against Primitive B (verbatim owner substring) at PROPOSE time — the
 * CONFIRMING turn's owner text is just "CONFIRM <token>", not the original note, so re-checking B there
 * would always fail; the validated note is instead carried in the pending-proposal payload and used
 * verbatim on commit.
 *
 * CR HARDENING (post-review fix): the confirm prompt is delivered DIRECTLY to the owner's chat via
 * `ctx.outbound.deliverToOwner` — the SAME outbound rail `chat_reply` uses, resolved from the ACTIVE
 * TURN's own origin, never a lever-guessed destination — and the tool NEVER returns `promptText`/the
 * token to the companion (a bare `{status:'proposed'}`). The companion is the exact untrusted component
 * Primitive C exists to defend against: if the token were handed back for the companion to "relay", a
 * hijacked companion could propose a DIFFERENT action than the one it tells the owner about, receive the
 * REAL token, and render its OWN false-labeled message — the owner would still be typing a token that
 * really matches, but for an action they never actually chose. Delivering server-side and withholding the
 * token from the tool's return value makes that structurally impossible: the companion cannot construct a
 * valid confirm message it never received. Primitive B alone is a substring check (insufficient against
 * negation/context-stripping, e.g. "approve" is a substring of "do NOT approve") — Primitive C, delivered
 * this way, is the actual defense: the owner sees the EXACT daemon-authored action description and only
 * their own reply (which the daemon re-derives server-side via Primitive A) can commit it.

 * same reader `tasks_get`/the Lead's `project_task_get` use. Scope is the one guard: `project` must be
 * one of this grant's granted projects (belt-and-suspenders, mirrors `board_list`'s own `project`
 * selector check) — a `taskId` that doesn't resolve on that project resolves to not-found via
 * `getProjectTask` itself.
 *
 * `board_create`/`board_update` are the ACT half (card 7975c034) — registered ONLY when at least one of
 * this grant's projects is act-mode (`hasActGrant`, exactly like `decision_resolve`'s own gate), so a
 * read-only grant's tool surface stays byte-identical. Both relay into the EXISTING loom-tasks write
 * path (`createProjectTask`/`updateProjectTask`, mcp/tasks.ts) rather than reimplementing board
 * mutation — same posture as `decision_resolve` reusing `db.answerQuestion`. There is deliberately NO
 * delete tool at all (card + owner sign-off 1039e892: no cross-project delete from chat).
 *
 * Both tools copy `decision_resolve`'s exact proven shape (its CR-hardened Primitive-C round-trip in
 * particular — see that lever's doc for the full rationale): every call (propose OR confirm) re-runs
 * the belt-and-suspenders scope/mayAct guard FIRST, then Primitive A (owner-authored turn), then
 * requires a reply-to route, then tries `attest.confirmPending` before ever proposing. A first call
 * PROPOSES (mints a token via `attest.proposeConfirmation`, delivers the prompt DIRECTLY to the owner
 * via `ctx.outbound.deliverToOwner` — never returned to the companion) and returns a bare
 * `{status:'proposed'}`; only a SECOND identical call, on the owner's own next turn containing that
 * token, actually calls into `createProjectTask`/`updateProjectTask`. A failed delivery fails closed
 * (nothing left pending). Owner sign-off 1039e892 made Primitive C MANDATORY for every board write
 * (not merely recommended, as the design note's own open fork initially had it) — both tools always
 * propose-then-confirm, with no lighter-weight path.
 *
 * `title`/`body` content is the one place this lever's guards diverge from `decision_resolve`: by default
 * Primitive B applies to `board_create`'s `title`/(if given) `body` and to `board_update`'s optional
 * `title`/`body` inputs — each must be a verbatim quote of the owner's own words this turn, so an injected
 * message can never fabricate card content. `board_update`'s closed-vocabulary fields (columnKey/priority/
 * held) are UNAFFECTED either way — never checked against Primitive B, mirroring how `decision_resolve`'s
 * own `chosenOption` (also a closed-vocabulary pick) is validated against the offered set rather than
 * checked verbatim.
 *
 * `authoredContent` (this card, Framework §4.5's Tier-A residual) is a per-project grant-config opt-in,
 * fail-closed default OFF, that CONDITIONS the Primitive-B verbatim-content check above: ON for a given
 * project, `board_create`/`board_update` may author real card text there instead of quoting the owner
 * verbatim. See {@link authoredContentAllowed}'s doc for the full safety framing — this never widens
 * scope, bypasses Primitive A, or waives the reply-to-route requirement; it only conditions Primitive B.
 *
 * `board_update` resolves its target card GLOBALLY (`db.getTask`, unscoped by project — the only way to
 * find out which project a bare card id belongs to) before checking that project against scope, exactly
 * mirroring how `decision_resolve` resolves `db.getQuestion` before its own scope check.
 *
 * `board_relocate` (card bfa25ea5, lever 5) is a THIRD ACT tool, gated by the SAME `hasActGrant` — it
 * reassigns a MISFILED card's `projectId` from one granted project to another, the one cross-project move
 * `board_update` cannot do (`updateProjectTask`/`db.updateTask` never touch `project_id`; see
 * `relocateProjectTask`, mcp/tasks.ts). Cross-project by nature, it requires act-mode on BOTH the card's
 * CURRENT project and the destination — never a single-project scope check — and is ALWAYS Tier X
 * (Framework §6.2): unlike `board_create`/`board_update`'s Tier A, it never flows through a warm trust
 * window and always steps up to a fresh owner confirm (its dead low-friction branch, if `mayProceedWithout
 * Confirm` ever regressed to `true` for "X", fails SAFE with an internal error rather than committing —
 * mirrors this file's sibling `session_spawn` lever's own Tier-X dead branch). It shares
 * `pendingBoardWrites`/`BOARD_REACH_SLUG` with the other two writes (one route, one outstanding board-write
 * confirmation at a time) via its own `{action:"relocate", taskId, toProject, fromProject}` variant of
 * `PendingBoardWrite` — `fromProject` (the source project AT PROPOSE TIME) is re-checked against the card's
 * CURRENT project on confirm, so a card that moved between propose and confirm can never silently commit a
 * different move than the one the owner actually confirmed. Refuses to relocate a card with a LIVE worker
 * session bound to it (`db.countLiveSessionsForTask`, mirroring the task-delete guard, gateway/server.ts) —
 * relocating out from under a running worker would strand it in the source project while the card moves.
 * No Primitive-B check applies — `taskId`/`toProject` are id references, not authored content. A relocated
 * card's connected decision-inbox Requests are re-homed right alongside it (card e7591ed2) — `db.relocateTask`
 * moves the task's `project_id` and every connected `questions` row's `project_id` in ONE transaction, so
 * they stay reachable as "connected" from the destination project's view of the card.

/**
 * `media-out` (Framework §4, card 3a81b0f2) — lets the owner review UI/design work from their phone ("show
 * me the latest mockup", "send a screenshot of the running app") by delivering an ALLOWLISTED file to
 * their chat. Registered ONLY when at least one of this grant's projects is act-mode (`hasActGrant`,
 * mirrors decision_resolve/board_create/update's own gate) — a read-only grant never sees this tool.
 *
 * THE ENTIRE SECURITY MODEL IS THE PATH ALLOWLIST — deliberately NO Primitive A/B/C (design note,
 * confirmed): there's no owner-composed content for this lever to attest, and the roots aren't a
 * project-decision like `decisionClasses` — the sole risk is EXFILTRATION, fully handled by a
 * realpath-guarded allowlist. `pathOrName` is resolved through the EXACT two-layer guard the vault reader
 * uses (`resolveVaultFilePath`, vault/browser.ts: lexical containment THEN a `realpathSync`
 * symlink-escape check), tried against EVERY root in this grant's allowlist — a `../` traversal, an
 * absolute path outside every root, or a symlink that resolves outside its root are all rejected; only a
 * path that resolves INSIDE some allowlisted root is ever readable/deliverable. The allowlist itself is
 * `config_json.roots: string[]`, union-merged across every granted project's own grant row (mirrors
 * attention-push's `alertClasses` union — see its `resolveConfig`) — an absent/empty roots list on EVERY
 * granted project admits NOTHING (conservative default, matching decisions-relay's own absent-allowlist
 * posture): the owner must explicitly configure at least one root before anything is deliverable. (Owner
 * sign-off 1039e892 named the recommended defaults for that config — vault `Assets/`, the session scratch
 * dir — but this lever's own code applies no implicit fallback: an empty configured
 * allowlist delivers nothing, exactly like an empty `decisionClasses`.)
 *
 * DELIVERY was TELEGRAM-FIRST v1 (owner decision 2026-07-09): `ctx.outbound.deliverMediaToOwner` resolves
 * the active turn's own route + adapter SERVER-SIDE (never a lever-guessed destination — mirrors
 * `deliverToOwner`). The in-app fast-follow (card 9ec79b52) closed the gap — the in-app channel now
 * delivers too (`InAppChannel.adapter.sendMedia`, companion/in-app.ts: a base64-inlined WS frame the web
 * chat renders inline). A channel with no media support at all still degrades GRACEFULLY
 * (`status:"unsupported-channel"`, naming the resolved path) rather than erroring, so the companion can
 * still tell the owner where the file lives instead of the call just failing — this is now future-proofing
 * for a channel that doesn't implement `sendMedia`, not the expected in-app path.

 * `session-steer` (Framework §4, card 305a54fb) — the session-control ACT lever, REFRAMED by owner
 * redirect (decisions `47532bd0` + `71509fd5`) from a verbatim-relay "steer" into a full OPERATOR
 * surface: on the owner's intent, the companion messages/steers/stops/resumes sessions in granted scope
 * — composed from owner intent, NOT a verbatim quote (Primitive B does NOT apply here, unlike
 * `board_create`'s title/body). Decision `71509fd5` = FULLY FRICTION-FREE: all four actions commit
 * IMMEDIATELY, on the first call — NO Primitive C propose/confirm round-trip (unlike `decision_resolve`/
 * `board_create`/`board_update`). This is deliberate, owner-accepted residual risk on Loom's most
 * injection-exposed surface — the safety model is NOT structural prevention of a bad action, it's:
 *
 *   - **Primitive A, MANDATORY, on every call**: `ctx.attest.getActiveTurnOwnerText` must be non-null —
 *     a proactive/heartbeat/reminder-originated turn can never reach `sessions`. This is the ONE
 *     structural backstop kept; every one of the four tools checks it before touching `ctx.sessions`.
 *   - **Scope, re-checked on EVERY call, including stop/resume**: the target session is resolved
 *     GLOBALLY first (`db.getSession`, exactly like `board_update` resolves a bare card id) — a bare
 *     sessionId names no project until resolved — THEN its project must be ∈ `ctx.scope.projectIds` AND
 *     `ctx.scope.mayAct` for it. There is no path from a granted project to an out-of-scope session: a
 *     target whose project was never granted, or was granted read-only, is rejected before `ctx.sessions`
 *     is ever called.
 *   - **Optional per-project `config_json.roleFilter`** (e.g. `["manager"]`) narrowing which session
 *     ROLES are controllable within a granted project. DEFAULT = no restriction (an absent or empty
 *     roleFilter admits every role) — the OPPOSITE default of `decisionClasses`' conservative
 *     admit-nothing, because the owner explicitly wants "whatever I want" here (card, decision
 *     `71509fd5`) once scope + Primitive A already hold.
 *
 * `resolveControlTarget` is the ONE place all four tools run this shared validation — a lever-internal
 * mirror of `registerCompanionCapabilities`' own "one enforcement point" discipline, so a future 5th
 * session-control tool can't reintroduce a bespoke (and possibly weaker) check.
 *
 * ACT-only (mirrors `media-out`'s own `supportsMode`) — registered ONLY when at least one granted project
 * is act-mode (`hasActGrant`); there is no lower-risk read half to split "control a session" from (session
 * visibility is `session-status`'s own, separately-granted lever). `ctx.sessions` (card 305a54fb) is a
 * narrow, SCOPED slice of `SessionService` — message/steer reuse the SAME durable cross-session delivery
 * channel the Platform Lead's own `session_message`/`redirectWorker` use (framed
 * `[loom:from-owner-via-companion]`/`[loom:from-owner-via-companion:redirect]` so a live receiver knows
 * the source), and stop/resume reuse `SessionService.stopSession`/`resume` UNCHANGED — see their own docs.

 *   - **Primitive A (owner-authored turn)**: `ctx.attest.getActiveTurnOwnerText` must be non-null,
 *     mirroring `session-steer`'s own `resolveControlTarget` (this file, ~L1294). This is NOT redundant
 *     with the DM-only check below — `ctx.pty.getActiveTurnSenderId` is null for EVERY
 *     non-companion-inbound turn, not just a DM (see `pty/host.ts`'s own doc): a PROACTIVE/heartbeat/
 *     reminder/memory-recall turn also has a null senderId. Without Primitive A, an injected instruction
 *     ("read session X and relay it later") that a GROUP turn refuses (non-null senderId) could still
 *     succeed on the companion's OWN next proactive turn (null senderId, no owner text) — reading the
 *     transcript into context with no owner ever having asked for it, ready to be relayed on a later
 *     group turn. Requiring owner authorship closes that: the owner asking "read session X" in a DM is
 *     owner-authored and still passes; a self-initiated proactive read is blocked.
 *   - **DM-only**: `ctx.pty.getActiveTurnSenderId(ctx.sessionId)` non-null (a GROUP route) fails closed
 *     — transcript text is UNTRUSTED DATA the companion is about to ingest and could relay onward, the
 *     strongest exfiltration surface among the read levers, since a GROUP route would let ANY member
 *     trigger a read whose result the companion might then summarize back into the group.
 * Both gates must pass; neither alone is sufficient (see above).
 *
 * PER-PROJECT resolve-then-scope (Framework §2, mandatory — §6.3), AFTER both gates: the target session
 * is resolved GLOBALLY (`db.getSession` / id-prefix) — a bare sessionId names no project until resolved
 * — THEN its project must be ∈ `ctx.scope.projectIds`. Unlike `session_transcript` (the Lead stands
 * ABOVE every project and needs no such filter), an id-PREFIX lookup here is filtered to in-scope
 * matches ONLY (`db.findSessionsByIdPrefix(...).filter(...)`) — `AMBIGUOUS_ID_ERROR` is returned only
 * for a genuinely-ambiguous prefix AMONG THE CALLER'S OWN GRANTED SESSIONS; an out-of-scope match is
 * invisible to the ambiguity check, not merely rejected after being found, so it can never surface as
 * "there's another session with this prefix" either. A resolved-but-out-of-scope session and a

 * `session-spawn` (Framework §4, Companion→Platform-Lead epic ccdb1e0c lever 7b) — lets the companion
 * spawn a NEW session into a granted project on the owner's behalf. THE epic's self-elevation surface,
 * so this is the single most heavily-guarded lever in the catalog: Tier X (Framework §6.2 — ALWAYS
 * steps up, even inside an otherwise-warm trust window) AND manager|plain ONLY, ACT-only (mirrors
 * `media-out`/`session-steer`'s own `hasActGrant` gate — there is no lower-risk read half to split
 * "spawn a session" from; session VISIBILITY stays `session-status`'s own separately-granted lever).
 *
 * Guards, checked IN ORDER on every call (propose OR confirm):
 *   (a) **THE #1 GUARD, before scope is even consulted**: `role` must be "manager" or "plain" — the
 *       EXACT same check + error text as the Platform Lead's own `session_spawn` (mcp/platform.ts),
 *       via the ONE shared `spawnableRoleError` helper (mcp/spawnable-role.ts) so the two can never
 *       drift apart. Never "platform"/"auditor"/"setup"/"worker"/anything else — no self-elevation, no
 *       reaching into a manager's own worker-orchestration job.
 *   (b) **Scope (resolve-then-scope)**: `project` ∈ `ctx.scope.projectIds` AND `ctx.scope.mayAct
 *       (project)` — a read-mode grant can never spawn.
 *   (c) **Primitive A**: `ctx.attest.getActiveTurnOwnerText` non-null — a proactive/heartbeat turn can
 *       never spawn.
 *   (d) **Reply-to route required**: `ctx.pty.getActiveTurnOrigin` non-null, fail closed — exactly like
 *       `decision_resolve`/`board_create`, needed for the Tier-X confirm round-trip below.
 *   (e) **Tier X propose/confirm**: `mayProceedWithoutConfirm(ctx.trustWindow, "X", …)` — for Tier X
 *       this ALWAYS returns false (see its own doc), so there is no low-friction direct-commit path at
 *       all, unlike `board_create`/`board_update`'s Tier A. The FIRST call PROPOSES (mints a token via
 *       `attest.proposeConfirmation`, delivers the prompt DIRECTLY to the owner via
 *       `ctx.outbound.deliverToOwner` — never returned to the companion, fail closed on delivery
 *       failure — and remembers the validated `{project, agentId, role}` in `pendingSpawns`); a SECOND
 *       identical call on the owner's own confirming turn commits via `ctx.attest.confirmPending`,
 *       re-checks the pending payload matches, and only then calls `ctx.sessions.spawnSession`.
 *       `onStepUpCommitted(…, "X", …)` is called after commit — for Tier X this never arms the trust
 *       window (confirming one self-elevation-adjacent action must never lower friction for the next
 *       one). Token-mismatch (retryable, left standing) and expired/never-existed (evicted before the
 *       fresh propose) are handled exactly like `board_create`.
 *
 * No free-text content here (`project`/`agentId`/`role` are all closed-vocabulary/id lookups, not
 * owner-authored prose), so Primitive B does not apply — mirrors `board_update`'s own posture.
