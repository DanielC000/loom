/**
 * Daemon-global registry of long-running orchestration ops (worker_spawn / worker_merge_confirm) that

 * throw-on-retry mutex) into a record whose outcome a client can come back for. Fixes the Auditor
 * b9515beb friction: a client-side MCP timeout on a minutes-long gate run used to leave the manager
 * unable to tell whether the op landed, and a retry bounced off a hard "already in flight" error instead
 * of finding out. One op per `key` at a time (spawn: `spawn:${taskId}`; merge: `merge:${workerSessionId}`).
 *
 * EVICT-ON-SETTLE (not a TTL): the entry is deleted from the map the MOMENT it settles (inside the
 * `run().then/.catch` callback in `attach()`), not merely once someone happens to consume it. This closes
 * two real bugs a TTL-based reap would only paper over: (a) a slow op that settled but was never
 * re-polled would otherwise surface FOREVER via `peek()`/`listByManager()` — for a merge that means
 * `pendingMerge` stays non-null after the merge is done (contradicts "non-null = still running"); for a
 * spawn it means the placeholder row lingers ALONGSIDE the real worker row `spawnWorker` inserted once it
 * settled (duplicate/over-count) — or, on a FAILED spawn, lingers forever as a phony `processState:
 * "starting"` that never reports the failure; (b) an unbounded map leak on a long-running daemon. A
 * concurrent awaiter that is STILL racing `e.settle` when eviction happens is unaffected — it holds `e` by
 * reference, not by a live map lookup, so it reads the correct final state/result/error regardless. A
 * caller that arrives AFTER eviction (a genuine "no entry" state, indistinguishable from one that was
 * never started) safely re-invokes the real operation — safe because BOTH callers of this registry lean
 * on their OWN pre-existing idempotency: confirmWorkerMerge's ALREADY_MERGED re-derive-from-clean-index,
 * and spawnWorker's `liveSessionIdForTask` live-worker guard — neither of which this registry duplicates.

   * again; this call just races the EXISTING op's settlement — so two callers can never trigger two real
   * invocations for the same key.
   *
   * Either way, races the op's settlement against `waitMs`: settles in time → the settle callback has
   * ALREADY evicted the entry (see the class doc) — this call just reads the final state/result/error off
   * its own `e` reference and returns it (served exactly once per real invocation, mirroring inbox_pull's

   * callback (never from a caller's fast path) — but ONLY if this key was actually surfaced to some caller
   * as `{settled:false}` first. A call that observes the op resolve within its own `waitMs` already has the
   * outcome inline and needs no push; a call that was told "pending" may never come back to poll again, so
   * the terminal callback is the one delivery path guaranteed to fire for it. Only the FIRST (entry-creating)
   * call's callback is ever wired — later attach() calls on the same in-flight key pass their own callback
   * closure too, but it's a no-op (the entry already exists, so `run()`/its `.then` are not re-registered);
   * this is harmless as long as callers derive equivalent callback content from the same key (true here).
