# 8db913e2 — a raise diverts to a pending record instead of overwriting a kept occupant's physical file

## Summary

A pre-existing follow-up from Code Review `2dd131b4` of `4900c365`, refined by three triage notes (Code
Review `91b49a21`, `b1d4614c`, and `fe4bb9ef`, all against `63e49ee2`) into three concrete repro shapes.
`enterMergeQuarantine`'s own raise-write call sites skip the degraded-occupant guard unconditionally
(`e1cb7d33`: a raise must persist, never refuse) with no fallback protection of their own:

1. `protectDegradedOccupantBeforeDelete`/`protectUnincorporatedOccupantBeforeDelete`'s own `false`
   return (a confirmed foreign occupant whose protective copy failed, or a non-ENOENT read failure with
   nothing to copy aside from) was IGNORED at every raise-write call site — the guard-skipped write then
   overwrote the kept occupant's file outright.
2. Even a `true` ("none") return can be STALE: `final`'s basename can be marked
   `keptUnreadableLatchFiles` from an EARLIER read failure that evicted the in-memory record without ever
   creating a pending one (`63e49ee2`'s own accepted residual) — a later raise of the SAME identity's own
   fresh, successful read proves only that THIS read worked, not that nothing was lost from memory.
3. A same-identity re-raise's rename SUCCEEDS but overwrites `final` without UNIONING whatever token(s)
   were already outstanding there.

## The fix

Design ruling (option (a) from the card's own triage): never refuse the raise's write (`e1cb7d33` still
holds) — instead DIVERT it to a pending-divert record when `final` cannot be safely written to, union
on-disk tokens forward when it can.

Two new functions in `merge-quarantine.ts`:

- `resolveRaiseOverwrite(final, ownRepoPath, ownTokens, protectOk)` — the single decision point every
  raise-write call site threads its own protect call's return through. `protectOk === true` with `final`'s
  basename NOT marked is the fast path (no-op for the overwhelming majority of raises). Otherwise this
  function re-reads `final` itself: `ENOENT`/`EISDIR` ⇒ proceed (nothing real there — see the EISDIR note
  below); any other read error ⇒ divert (a real file exists that cannot be read); a successful read with
  the SAME identity ⇒ carry its on-disk tokens forward; a different identity already covered by token
  overlap (the existing-branch's own `unincorporatedOccupantRepoPathAt` exemption, re-derived here so a
  prior union's own winning-side leftover is never spuriously re-protected) ⇒ unchanged; a different,
  still-unresolvable identity ⇒ durably protect it via `protectOccupantContentBeforeDelete` before the
  write proceeds, diverting only if THAT protect call also fails; corrupt or a different-but-resolvable
  identity ⇒ unchanged (today's existing, deliberately-unprotected case).
- `divertRaiseEntry(entry)` — unions `entry` into whatever pending record already matches its own identity
  (durably rewriting it in place), or mints a brand-new `pending-<24hex>.json` record otherwise, mirroring
  `enterMergeQuarantine`'s own pre-existing `!verified` brand-new-divert branch. Never touches `final`.

Wired at every raise-write call site in `enterMergeQuarantine`: the `existing`-truthy branch's own
`protectUnincorporatedOccupantBeforeDelete` call, and the `verified`-gated `protectDegradedOccupantBeforeDelete`
call in the "no existing" region (covering both the pending-merge write and the brand-new-entry write,
since the divert decision runs before either is reached).

### The EISDIR trap (round 1 of this card) — a regression against `merge-quarantine-boot-hardening.mjs`

A first version of `resolveRaiseOverwrite` diverted unconditionally whenever `protectOk` was `false`,
without re-reading `final` itself. This reproduced, on the RAISE side, the EXACT mistake `63e49ee2` round
4 already made and reverted on the CLEAR side: `merge-quarantine-boot-hardening.mjs`'s own
WRITE-FAILURE-RESIDUE scenarios (`WFR-1`, `PCWF`) deliberately create a DIRECTORY at a latch's own final
path to force a deterministic rename failure — reading a directory throws `EISDIR`, which the existing
detectors already classify as `"unknown"` (by design, unchanged — see `63e49ee2`'s own round-5 "Do not"),
so `protectOk` was `false` for a reason that has nothing to do with lost foreign content: a directory can
never hold valid latch JSON in this module. Diverting here rerouted the raise to a pending-divert record
instead of letting the pre-existing, already-tested tmp-residue-on-failed-rename mechanism run, breaking
both scenarios' own hardcoded tmp-file expectations.

**The fix:** `resolveRaiseOverwrite` always re-reads `final` itself (never short-circuits on `protectOk`
alone) and classifies `EISDIR` the same as `ENOENT` — nothing real to protect, proceed with the ordinary
write. Only a genuinely unreadable FILE (EACCES/EPERM/EMFILE/...) diverts. Verified directly: reverting
just this EISDIR carve-out reproduces the `WFR-1`/`PCWF` regression; restoring it, and nothing else,
fixes both.

## Tests

`packages/daemon/test/merge-quarantine-raise-protect-failure.mjs` (new) — three scenarios, each with its
own reboot assertion, measuring the TOKEN directly (never `assertRepoNotQuarantined`):

- **shape 1** ("fp:reraise") — a confirmed, pure-pending (no `resolvedKey`) foreign occupant D sits at R's
  own key; D's final is left persistently unreadable (EACCES) when R raises. Asserts D's own content
  survives byte-for-byte, R's own raise still persists in-process (diverted), and both tokens survive a
  reboot. Its own positive control (no injection) confirms today's existing, legitimate-overwrite path
  (D safely relocated, R's write lands at `final`) is unchanged.
- **shape 2** ("no-fault") — a transient read failure marks `final`'s basename kept and evicts D's
  in-memory record (no pending record is ever created on an "unknown" read); D becomes resolvable and
  raises itself again (same identity). Asserts the re-raise carries D's ORIGINAL token forward, both
  in-process and across a reboot. Its own control (no injection) confirms the bug is read-failure
  specific, not the scenario shape itself.
- **existing-branch** — the SAME decision wired at `enterMergeQuarantine`'s OTHER raise-write site (the
  `existing`-truthy region): D2 is armed directly at boot (its own `resolvedKey`), so R2's own raise into
  D2's already-armed entry reaches `existing` truthy with a persistently-unreadable final. Asserts
  `final`'s own original bytes are untouched and both D2's and R2's tokens survive, in-process and across
  a reboot.

`round5-rename-unmarks` in `merge-quarantine-protect-read-failure.mjs` (rewritten in place — this is shape
3's own dedicated fixture, not duplicated in the new file): asserts the re-raise now carries the ORIGINAL
token forward, that a partial clear of only the fresh token leaves the file on disk with the original
still active (in-process AND across a reboot), and that clearing the original token too finally unlinks
the file. The file's own stale `KNOWN GAP` note (naming this card) is removed.

All three new assertions (shape 1, shape 2, existing-branch) and `round5-rename-unmarks`'s new assertions
proven RED against `HEAD` (pre-fix) and GREEN after, via `scripts/negative-control.mjs` — including the
EISDIR regression: `merge-quarantine-boot-hardening.mjs` passes clean on BOTH sides, confirming it was
never a discriminator for this card's own fix (it was a REGRESSION this card's round 1 caused and round 1
fixed in the same pass, before any of this was reported as `done`). All 33 `merge-quarantine*.mjs` files
re-verified individually, each exit 0. All static guards (`pnpm --filter @loom/daemon guards`)
re-verified green.

## Round 3 (Code Review 1da7261f) — two FURTHER regressions round 2's own chokepoint union introduced

Code Review `1da7261f` found two Critical blockers in round 2's own fix, both regressions of round 2:

- **B1, fail-closed RESURRECTION.** A partial clear's own write (`clearActiveEntryTokenAtKey`) hits
  `final`'s own MARKED basename, so `writeMergeQuarantineLatch`'s chokepoint re-reads `final` and unions
  its on-disk tokens forward — but a STALE pre-clear copy of those bytes can still carry the EXACT token
  this clear just durably removed, resurrecting it. Repro: `t1=enter(R); t2=enter(R)`; fail reads #1-#2 of
  `final` during `t3=enter(R)` (diverts, carrying `t1,t2,t3` forward in a pending twin, `final` untouched
  at `[t1,t2]`); restore reads; `clearByToken(R,t1)` — the chokepoint's own union reads `final`'s still-
  `[t1,t2]` bytes and re-adds `t1`, even though this exact write just durably removed it.
- **B2, FAIL-OPEN.** `foldInOnDiskTokensIfMarked` (the caller's own reconciliation, run before arming) and
  `writeMergeQuarantineLatch`'s own chokepoint each read `final` SEPARATELY for the SAME write. A
  transient failure between the two could let memory and disk diverge (one succeeds, one fails) — or,
  when BOTH fail, the chokepoint's own `skipDegradedOccupantGuard` branch proceeded BLIND ("should be
  unreachable in practice, safe either way"), overwriting `final` outright and losing the on-disk
  occupant's content immediately.

### The fix

1. **`clearedTokens`** (`merge-quarantine.ts`) — a process-wide `Set<string>` of every token this process
   has deliberately cleared: by-token (`clearActiveEntryTokenAtKey`/`clearPendingEntryByToken`, tombstoned
   BEFORE either function's own write, since tokens are random v4 UUIDs never re-minted and that write's
   own chokepoint union must see the tombstone to correctly exclude the token it is dropping), and every
   token of an UNCONDITIONAL full clear's own successfully-destroyed copy (see point 2 — never at a bare
   "an entry occupies this key" lookup). Subtracted from `reconcileMarkedBasenameBeforeWrite`'s own union
   of on-disk tokens — the one shared chokepoint every write-time union runs through. In-memory only; a
   reboot resets it, safely, because a reboot re-reads disk fresh and the clear's own durable write already
   removed the token from that entry's file before the process exited.
2. **Tombstone only on a CONFIRMED destroy, never on a bare key-occupancy lookup.** `clearMergeQuarantineByKey`
   can legitimately find an entry armed at the key being cleared and then KEEP its physical file,
   fail-closed, when protection is uncertain (`d2582692`'s own shape — a degraded, walked-up key can be
   occupied by a wholly foreign entry). Tombstoning at that bare lookup (the FIRST implementation tried
   here, which turned the `b1` test from round 2 red for the wrong reason) would wrongly suppress that
   entry's own later, legitimate reconciliation from its still-physically-present bytes. The fix:
   tombstone ONLY inside `deleteMergeQuarantineLatchByKey`'s own successful-unlink branch (`finalProtectOk`
   true, via `clearedEntry.tokens`), and ONLY after a pending-entry sweep (`sweepOwnLatchFileUnlessOwnedElsewhere`)
   reports `kept:false` for that entry's own `sourceFile` — never before either outcome is known.
3. **ONE READ PER WRITE.** `foldInOnDiskTokensIfMarked` now returns `MergeQuarantineEntry | "unreadable"`
   (never silently swallowing `"unreadable"` into the unchanged entry, as round 2 did) — the SAME result
   the caller already computed before arming is passed into `writeMergeQuarantineLatch` via a new
   `reconciledAlready` parameter, which skips the chokepoint's own independent re-read entirely when set.
   Every raise call site (`enterMergeQuarantine`'s two direct write sites, `consumeMatchedPendingsIntoArmedEntry`)
   now does the reconciliation ONCE and reuses it for both the in-memory entry and the durable write.
4. **An "unreadable" result at a raise now diverts, never proceeds blind.** When the caller's own
   fold-in reconciliation is `"unreadable"`, a raise diverts via `divertRaiseEntry` INSTEAD of arming or
   writing at all (e1cb7d33 still holds — the raise persists via the divert). The chokepoint's own
   defensive fallback (for a raise reaching it un-pre-reconciled, which no current call site does) also
   diverts rather than "proceeding anyway" — the stale comment claiming that was safe either way is gone.
5. **`consumeMatchedPendingsIntoArmedEntry`'s own silent write-failure.** `activeMergeQuarantineFor`'s
   `direct`-truthy sibling-absorb call site discarded this function's own `writeSucceeded` with no log at
   all — fixed to log the same way its OTHER call site (the no-`direct` branch) already does.

### Tests

`merge-quarantine-raise-protect-failure.mjs`:
- **b1-resurrection** — `t1=enter(R); t2=enter(R)`; fail reads #1-#2 of `final` during `t3=enter(R)`
  (diverts); restore; `clearByToken(R,t1)` — asserts `final` durably EXCLUDES t1 (not merely that it's
  gone in-process). A SECOND, independent transient read failure during a fresh `t4=enter(R)` proves the
  tombstone survives more than the one failure that exposed the bug. Clearing t2/t3/t4 afterward asserts R
  is fully lifted, never left permanently stuck on a resurrected t1 — in-process, on disk, and after a reboot.
- **b2-r3** / **b2-r3r4** — the card's own B2 repro (D's raise while `final`'s marked basename is still
  unreadable), run twice: failing only read #3 (`foldIn`'s own read) and failing reads #3 AND #4 (the
  pre-fix chokepoint's own now-unreachable second read) — both must produce the identical, fixed outcome
  (diverted, `final` untouched, ORIG correctly rejoins at the next graduation, survives a partial clear and
  a reboot).

Both proven RED on `d1c88668` (round 2, this card's own `9afda0c2`→`d1c88668` state) and GREEN after, via
`scripts/negative-control.mjs`. B2 is structurally inapplicable to round 1 (`9afda0c2`): that commit has
NEITHER `reconcileMarkedBasenameBeforeWrite` NOR `foldInOnDiskTokensIfMarked` at all (zero occurrences) —
`writeMergeQuarantineLatch` had no marked-basename chokepoint whatsoever, so there is no "two separate
reads of the same write" shape to pose the same way; not independently run against it.

All 33 `merge-quarantine*.mjs` files re-verified individually, each exit 0. All static guards
(`pnpm --filter @loom/daemon guards`) re-verified green.

## Do not

- Do not let a raise-write call site ignore its own protect call's (`protectDegradedOccupantBeforeDelete`/
  `protectUnincorporatedOccupantBeforeDelete`) `false` return — thread it into `resolveRaiseOverwrite`.
- **(SUPERSEDED BY ROUND 2)** The original text of this bullet said a `true` ("none") protect result,
  when `final`'s basename is marked, must be re-derived inside `resolveRaiseOverwrite` itself. Round 2
  moved that re-derivation into `reconcileMarkedBasenameBeforeWrite`, run from `writeMergeQuarantineLatch`'s
  own chokepoint (every writer, not just a raise) — `resolveRaiseOverwrite` no longer carries forward
  on-disk tokens at all; it only decides divert vs. proceed. Do not re-add that logic to
  `resolveRaiseOverwrite` — the same "same identity is not same content" lesson `63e49ee2` round 5 learned
  on the clear side still applies, just at the one shared chokepoint now, never duplicated per call site.
- Do not treat `EISDIR` as "divert" on the raise side — a directory can never hold valid latch content in
  this module; treat it exactly like `ENOENT` (nothing real there, proceed) and let the pre-existing
  tmp-residue-on-failed-write mechanism handle an actual directory blocker. See the "EISDIR trap" section
  above for the regression this closes and the two tests (`WFR-1`, `PCWF` in
  `merge-quarantine-boot-hardening.mjs`) that catch a reversion of it.
- Do not use an identity-only check (mirroring `differentUnresolvableOccupantRepoPathAt`) inside
  `resolveRaiseOverwrite` for the existing-branch call site without ALSO checking token overlap first —
  `entry`'s own physical final can legitimately differ from the new raiser's identity while already being
  fully accounted for (a prior union's own winning side, `e0192ffb`'s own established exemption); skipping
  the overlap check would spuriously divert already-incorporated content into a duplicate pending record.
- Do not invent a second copy-aside primitive for the "different, still-unresolvable identity" branch —
  `resolveRaiseOverwrite` calls `protectOccupantContentBeforeDelete` directly, reusing its existing
  re-point/union logic.
- Do not assert `assertRepoNotQuarantined` as the discriminating check for a NEW test on this shape — as
  with every other card in this module, assert on the real TOKEN set (`listActiveMergeQuarantines().flatMap(q => q.tokens ?? [])`)
  directly.
- Do not construct a test fixture for the "no existing" raise-write region with a `resolvedKey` field on
  the foreign occupant — that arms it DIRECTLY into `activeQuarantines` at boot, routing any later raise
  at that same key into the `existing`-truthy region instead (a structurally different branch, already
  safe-by-construction there via token accumulation) rather than the brand-new-entry write this card's
  shape-1/shape-2 repros actually target. Leave `resolvedKey` off to keep the occupant pure-pending.
- **(Round 3)** Do not tombstone a token at a BARE "an entry occupies this key" lookup
  (`clearMergeQuarantineByKey`'s own `activeQuarantines.get(key)`, or an equivalent pending-entry filter
  match) — that entry can be a wholly FOREIGN occupant this exact clear ends up KEEPING, fail-closed,
  when protection is uncertain (`d2582692`'s shape). Tombstone ONLY once the actual outcome is known: a
  confirmed successful unlink (`deleteMergeQuarantineLatchByKey`'s own `finalProtectOk` branch) or a
  confirmed non-kept sweep (`sweepOwnLatchFileUnlessOwnedElsewhere`'s own `kept:false`). This was the
  FIRST implementation tried here, and it turned the pre-existing `b1` test (round 2's own repro) from
  PASS into a DIFFERENT failure — caught only by re-running the full corpus, not by this card's own new
  scenarios, which never happened to exercise a degraded-key eviction.
- **(Round 3)** Do not let `clearActiveEntryTokenAtKey`/`clearPendingEntryByToken`'s own by-token
  tombstone wait for their OWN write to succeed first — tombstone `token` BEFORE calling that write, or
  the write's own chokepoint union (when `final`'s basename happens to be marked) cannot see the
  tombstone and will re-include the very token this write is deliberately dropping. This is safe (not a
  second instance of the bare-lookup mistake above): by construction, THIS write is the one genuinely
  removing `token`, not a bystander clear that merely happens to occupy the same key.
- **(Round 3)** Do not have `writeMergeQuarantineLatch`'s chokepoint re-read `final` when the caller
  passes `reconciledAlready:true` — that flag means the caller already ran the SAME reconciliation this
  write needs, and a second, independent read of the same file for the same write is exactly the CR2 B2
  shape (a transient failure between two reads letting memory and disk diverge).
- **(Round 3)** Do not restore the chokepoint's old "proceed anyway, should be unreachable, safe either
  way" comment/behavior for an `"unreadable"` result at a raise (`skipDegradedOccupantGuard` true) — call
  `divertRaiseEntry` instead, even though every current raise call site already pre-reconciles and
  diverts itself before ever reaching this function in that state (this is a defensive fallback, not the
  primary mechanism — see CR2 B2 for what happens when the two reads disagree with no fallback at all).

## Where the rest of this record went

Card `3608937e` split the former single record (pinned blob `2f1a55286d01`) into one record per follow-up id, so no record's Do-not extract exceeds the per-record cap. This file keeps the card's own Round 1 and Round 3 (with their Do-not bullets). Every other section, each with its own Do-not bullets, lives in the record named here (section text and ids unchanged; relative references like "the section above" now point into these files):
